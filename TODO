Contact List - "What she wants to do is to be able to keep a record of
calls made to each person in her rolodex.  She wants to be able to
query her database for folks she hasn't called or heard from in a
while, and to be able to scroll through (and even grep through) notes
made on previous calls so she can pull together status information."

 - when printing, if a field is empty, leave it out of the printout
   (this may be a question of taste, I'm not sure; maybe an option?)

 - some X resources to control fonts (type and size), printer vs file
   output by default (i.e. what comes up preselected in the print popup), 
   etc. would be very nice

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

add better control over output on printing. should be able to select 
which fields to print.

 I just compiled XmAddressBook (X11R6/Motif2.0) on a HP system and it runs
 fine, exept it apparently refuses all 8bit characters.  Is there something
 I can do to fix that ?

1)  It would be nice if a "Pager" field could be added for a pager number.
    Today I can use the comment section, but a separate pager (or maybe
    "Other" phone number) would make it faster to find the data.

2)  When using the Misc->Show_Name_List function, I have several cards
    that have only company names and no individual names.  So, these
    cards show up with a blank "Name".  In the case where the name is
    blank, would it be possible to perhaps put the Company field into
    that slot, perhaps bracketed by parens (i.e. "(" and ")" )?

    I use this feature, for instance, when I have a central phone number
    for a company, and have separate entries for the individual engineers
    I work with at that company.

3)  When using the Misc->Send_Mail function, I would like to be able to
    somehow call my own mail program (using the e-mail address from
    XmAddressBook) rather than the built-in mail shell.  Would there be
    some way to make an option that when I selected this function it would
    pass the e-mail address into a command that I wish to use?  (Ultimately
    I would love to get XmAddressBook to work together with the EXMH mail
    program.)
